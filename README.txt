FastQ Screen - Contmaination screening for NGS data sets
==========================================================
FastQ screen is a simple application which allows you to 
search a large sequence dataset against a panel of different
databases to build up a picture of where the sequences 
in your data originate. It was built as a QC check for
sequencing pipelines but may also have uses in metagenomics
studies where mixed samples are expected.
